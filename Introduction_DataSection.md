 # Customer Segmentation for _Retail Businesses_

This is the age of Startups. People all over the world are interested in making their own busines/ self-employment groom. What I have found in my research is that many "Retail Shops" are coming up in the markets of different places in the world. My idea is to do a **Segmentation Analysis** of the customers,in Europe, based on their frequency of buying, and last buying date.

My idea of this project is fostered by the news that FourSquare has recently  introduced a new API for 'StartUps and New Businesses'.   
Here I am providing a link to the news that I found...
[*Here is the link*](https://venturebeat.com/2018/04/12/foursquare-launches-places-api-for-startups-and-small-businesses/)
Using this API, businesses can access location based on data.

## Data Section

I will be using the Dataset of [*Online Retail*](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail#) obtaind from  **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. 

This dataset contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based online retail store.The company mainly sells all-occasion gifts. Most of the customers of the company are wholesalers.
Through this Analysis, I want to come to a conclusion of Customer Clusters that can help small-scale businesses to bloom.

### _Description of the Data_

The Dataset contains 8 features and 541909 observations.  The 8 features(or attributes) are -

**InvoiceNo:** Invoice number. A 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction.

**StockCode:** Product code. A 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.

**Description:** Product name. 

**Quantity:** The quantities of each product per transaction.
